# DFIR Companion

Localhost server that ingests browser screenshots as forensic evidence, runs
windowed AI analysis into an accumulating investigation state, reconstructs a
**forensic timeline** (real event timestamps) and **attacker path**, and serves a
live dashboard. Paired with the MV3 capture extension in `../extension`.

## Quick start

    cd companion
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env        # then edit .env (cases root, AI provider/model/key)
    npm run dev

Server listens on **http://127.0.0.1:4773** (localhost only). Dashboard at
http://127.0.0.1:4773/dashboard. On startup it logs the resolved cases root, e.g.
`[DFIR] cases root: ...\cases`.

> If you see `EADDRINUSE`, a companion is already running. Reuse it, or free the port:
> `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4773 -State Listen | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }`

## Configuration (`companion/.env`, gitignored)

| Variable | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DFIR_CASES_ROOT` | Where case folders are written. Relative paths resolve against `companion/`, so the same folder is used no matter where you launch from. | `./cases` or `../cases` |
| `DFIR_PORT` | Port the localhost server binds to. Default `4773`. Must be 1–65535; invalid values fall back to the default with a warning. Change this if 4773 is taken, or to run multiple companions side-by-side. The extension and dashboard must use the same port. | `4773` or `4774` |
| `DFIR_AI_PROVIDER` | `openai` \| `openrouter` \| `ollama` \| `litellm` \| `gemini`. Leave **unset** to run capture-only (no AI). | `litellm` |
| `DFIR_AI_MODEL` | Model id understood by the provider. | `ollama/llama3.1` |
| `DFIR_AI_KEY` | Provider API key (blank for an auth-less local LiteLLM proxy). | `sk-...` |
| `DFIR_AI_BASE_URL` | Override the provider's API base URL. Needed for a self-hosted **LiteLLM** proxy or any OpenAI-compatible local endpoint. `litellm` defaults to `http://localhost:4000/v1`. | `http://localhost:4000/v1` |
| `DFIR_AI_IMAGE_DETAIL` | `high` \| `low` \| `auto` (default `high`). High tiles screenshots at full resolution for accurate small-text OCR (OpenAI/OpenRouter models). | `high` |
| `DFIR_AI_SYNTH_PROVIDER` / `DFIR_AI_SYNTH_MODEL` / `DFIR_AI_SYNTH_KEY` | Optional **synthesis** model (findings / MITRE / attacker path). The vars above are the cheap per-screenshot **extraction** model; point a stronger model here for the one text-only synthesis call. Unset → reuses the extraction model. | `google/gemini-2.5-pro` |

Other AI tunables: `DFIR_AI_TIMEOUT_MS` (per-request timeout, default 180000),
`DFIR_AI_MAX_TOKENS` (max completion tokens, default 16000 — also stops OpenRouter from
402-ing a large request by over-reserving credit), `DFIR_AI_SYNTH_MAX_EVENTS`
(events fed to the synthesis prompt, default 300, most-severe first), and
`DFIR_AI_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (the model's context window, default **128000**). Every prompt is
budgeted to fit `DFIR_AI_CONTEXT_TOKENS`: the synthesis/ask timelines are trimmed, CSV/log
imports are batched by token budget (not just row count), and the state-summary echo is
bounded — so a big case no longer fails with *"maximum context length is 128000 tokens"*.
Raise it for a bigger-context model (Claude 200k, Gemini 1M); the default only trims
genuinely huge prompts. A prompt that still can't fit fails fast with an actionable message
instead of a cryptic upstream 400.

Local models via **LiteLLM**: run [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) as a local gateway
in front of Ollama / vLLM / any of its 100+ backends — it speaks the OpenAI chat-completions
API, so the companion talks to it natively. Start the proxy (`litellm --model ollama/llama3.1`,
default port `4000`), then set `DFIR_AI_PROVIDER=litellm` and `DFIR_AI_MODEL=<your proxy model>`.
The `litellm` provider defaults `DFIR_AI_BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:4000/v1`; set that var
only to change the host/port (e.g. a proxy on another box). Leave `DFIR_AI_KEY` blank for an
auth-less proxy, or set it to the proxy's master/virtual key. Screenshot extraction needs a
**multimodal** model; text-only models still drive CSV/log/synthesis (pair them via the two-tier
`DFIR_AI_SYNTH_*` vars). Keeping everything on-box means evidence never leaves your network.

Direct local **Ollama** (no proxy): Ollama already serves a native OpenAI-compatible API, so you
can skip LiteLLM entirely — set `DFIR_AI_PROVIDER=ollama`, `DFIR_AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1`,
and `DFIR_AI_MODEL` to a pulled model (a **vision** model such as `llama3.2-vision` for screenshot
extraction). Leave `DFIR_AI_KEY` blank — Ollama ignores it. *Without* `DFIR_AI_BASE_URL` the `ollama`
provider targets hosted Ollama Cloud (`https://ollama.com/v1`), which does need a key.

Self-hosted enrichment TLS: if your **MISP** or **YETI** instance presents an internal-CA
or self-signed cert, set `DFIR_MISP_CA` / `DFIR_YETI_CA` to a PEM CA-bundle path to trust a
private CA (verification stays on), or `DFIR_MISP_INSECURE` / `DFIR_YETI_INSECURE` (`=1`) to
skip verification for a lab (insecure — logs a warning). Each is scoped to that one provider
via an injected undici dispatcher; VirusTotal/AbuseIPDB and the AI calls keep the verified store.

Custom AI prompts: override any of the five built-in prompts — `SYSTEM` (per-screenshot
extraction), `CSV`, `LOG`, `SYNTH` (holistic synthesis), `ASK` (case Q&A) — via env. Set `DFIR_AI_<NAME>_PROMPT`
for inline text, or `DFIR_AI_<NAME>_PROMPT_FILE` to point at a file. The **file** is re-read on
each AI call, so editing it applies on the next analysis with **no restart**; an unreadable/empty
file falls back to the built-in prompt with a warning. `npm run prompts:eject` writes the four
defaults to `./prompts` so you can start from them.

Shell environment variables override `.env`. `GET /health` returns `{ aiEnabled }`
so you can confirm whether an AI provider is configured.

## npm scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the server (reads `.env`). |
| `npm run build` | Type-check / compile with `tsc`. |
| `npm test` | Run the full vitest suite. |
| `npm run verify:ai -- [caseId]` | One-call smoke test: confirms the configured model returns schema-valid JSON and prints findings / forensic events / attacker path. Samples screenshots from the middle of the case (default `test1`). |
| `npm run coverage -- [caseId]` | Reports how many of a case's screenshots were actually analyzed vs. skipped (duplicates) vs. never analyzed. |
| `npm run reanalyze -- <caseId> [flags]` | Re-run AI analysis over already-captured screenshots, rebuilding the investigation state, then synthesize conclusions. See flags below. |
| `npm run synthesize -- <caseId>` | Holistic pass: read the full forensic timeline and derive findings, MITRE mapping, and the attacker-path narrative. One text-only AI call. Accepts `--provider`/`--model`/`--key` overrides. |
| `npm run clean-timeline -- <caseId> [--apply]` | Remove analyst/tool-usage entries (Velociraptor hunts, notebooks, searches, "Response and Monitoring accessed") that don't belong in the forensic timeline. No AI calls. Dry-run preview by default; `--apply` saves. |
| `npm run prompts:eject -- [dir]` | Write the four built-in AI prompts (`system`/`csv`/`log`/`synthesis`) to files (default `./prompts`) so you can customize them, then point the `DFIR_AI_*_PROMPT_FILE` env vars at them. |

### `reanalyze` flags

| Flag | Effect | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<caseId>` | Case to process (first positional arg). | `test1` |
| `--reset` | Start from an empty state before analyzing (otherwise merges into existing). | off |
| `--all` | Include duplicate screenshots too (most thorough; more API calls). Otherwise only non-duplicates. | off |
| `--window N` | Screenshots per AI call. | `4` |
| `--provider NAME` | Override `DFIR_AI_PROVIDER` (extraction model) for this run. | from `.env` |
| `--model ID` | Override `DFIR_AI_MODEL` (extraction model) for this run. | from `.env` |
| `--key KEY` | Override `DFIR_AI_KEY` for this run. | from `.env` |
| `--base-url URL` | Override `DFIR_AI_BASE_URL` (e.g. a local LiteLLM proxy) for this run. | from `.env` |
| `--synth-model ID` | Use a **different (stronger) model for the synthesis pass** — findings / MITRE / attacker path. Per-screenshot extraction still uses `--model`. | = extraction model |
| `--synth-provider NAME` / `--synth-key KEY` / `--synth-base-url URL` | Provider/key/base-URL for the synthesis model (if different). | = extraction provider/key/base-URL |
| `--no-synthesis` | Skip the final synthesis pass (raw forensic timeline only, no findings/attacker path). | off |

Examples:

    npm run coverage -- test1
    npm run reanalyze -- test1 --reset                       # re-do all unique screenshots, fresh
    npm run reanalyze -- test1 --all --reset                 # include duplicates too
    npm run reanalyze -- test1 --reset --model openai/gpt-4o # try a different model
    # Two-tier (recommended): cheap model reads every screenshot, strong model writes conclusions
    npm run reanalyze -- test1 --reset --model openai/gpt-4o-mini --synth-model openai/gpt-4o

> `reanalyze` uses your API quota (~1 call per `--window` screenshots).

## HTTP endpoints

| Method & path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Reachability + `{ ok, aiEnabled }`. |
| `GET /cases` | List existing cases (newest first), each `{ caseId, name, createdAt, investigator, aiProvider }`. The extension's case dropdown uses this. |
| `POST /cases` | Create a case: `{ caseId, name, investigator, aiProvider }`. **The one place a case is born** (the dashboard's **+ New case** form and CLI tooling); returns **409** if the id already exists. The extension no longer creates cases. |
| `POST /captures` | Ingest a screenshot: `{ caseId, timestamp, url, tabTitle, triggerType, imageBase64 }`. Returns **404** if the case doesn't exist — captures never auto-create a case (create it in the dashboard first). |
| `POST /cases/:id/import` | **Unified import** — the dashboard's single **Import** button posts any data file here: `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. The server **auto-detects** the type (`importDetect.ts`: JSON/NDJSON vs CSV vs log, then per-format signatures) and dispatches to the matching importer below (or the AI CSV/log path). Optional **`minSeverity`** (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`/`info`; blank/`info` = everything) is a **gate-aware** floor (`analysis/severityFloor.ts`) applied to **every** import kind: an import that grades severity keeps only events at/above the floor, but an import that carries **no** severity (all-Info host triage like KAPE/Plaso, plain telemetry) is **kept in full** — "if there are no severities, import everything". Evidence-first; returns `202 { accepted, kind, file, minSeverity }` with the detected `kind` (so a mis-route is visible) and the normalized floor. (Images go to `POST /captures`, not here.) |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-csv` | Import a CSV result export (e.g. a Velociraptor artifact): `{ filename, csv }`. Persists the raw CSV as evidence, extracts dated forensic events + IOCs from the rows, then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, rows }`; progress streams over the WS. (The per-format routes back the unified `/import` above.) |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-thor` | Import a **THOR (Nextron) scanner report** in JSON-Lines format (`thor --jsonfile`): `{ filename, json, minLevel? }`. Optional `minLevel` is a severity floor — `"alert"` (only Alerts), `"warning"` (Alerts+Warnings), or `"notice"` (all, default) — so you can cut volume (the dashboard prompts for it). Persists the raw report as evidence, then maps findings **deterministically** (no AI extraction) to the timeline + IOCs — `level` → severity (Alert→Critical, Warning→High, Notice→Medium), reading each finding's own artifact time, pulling hashes/files/processes/IPs as IOCs, and collapsing identical findings. **Scan noise is dropped by default**: `level:"Info"` rows and lifecycle modules (`Init`, `Startup`, `Control`, `ThorDB`, `Report`). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, findings, dropped, total }`. The dashboard's **Import THOR** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-siem` | Import a **SIEM / EDR JSON export** — the second JSON ingest path besides THOR, for Elastic/Kibana, Splunk, an EDR console, or a raw winlogbeat dump: `{ filename, json, minSeverity? }`. Optional `minSeverity` is a severity floor (`"low"` drops Info noise like logoffs/process-terminated; `"medium"`/`"high"`/`"critical"` keep only that level and above; blank keeps everything). Persists the raw export as evidence, then maps it **deterministically** (no AI extraction): the container is unwrapped (`{ data: [{ _source }] }`, `{ hits: { hits } }`, a plain array, NDJSON, or `{ events\|records\|results }`); **Windows Event Log + Sysmon** records get a per-EID mapping (label, derived severity — failed-logon→Medium, service-install/explicit-cred→High, LSASS access / suspicious LOLBin command-line bumped, benign csrss CreateRemoteThread downgraded — plus MITRE, IOC + asset/account extraction with `::ffff:` IPs unwrapped and Sysmon hashes parsed); any **other** SIEM/EDR record falls back to field auto-detection (timestamp / host / message / severity). Repetitive identical events are **aggregated** into one counted row and the total is capped, so an 11k-event export doesn't flood the timeline. Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import SIEM/EDR** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-chainsaw` | Import **Chainsaw hunt output** or a **raw EVTX dump** — the third JSON ingest path, and the richest for Windows IR: `{ filename, json, minSeverity? }`. Accepts [Chainsaw](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/chainsaw) `hunt --json`/`--jsonl` (a JSON array or NDJSON of detections) **or** `evtx_dump -o json`/`jsonl` (bare `{ Event: { System, EventData } }` records), auto-detected per record. Persists the raw file as evidence, then maps it **deterministically** (no AI extraction). For a Chainsaw detection the matched **Sigma/built-in rule** leads the description, its **level drives severity**, and its `attack.tXXXX` **tags become MITRE techniques** — on top of the same per-EID Windows/Sysmon mapping + IOC/asset/hash/process-chain extraction as `import-siem`, run against the **embedded EVTX event** (`document.data.Event` / aggregate `documents[]`). A raw `evtx_dump` record (named EventData **or** the `Data[{@Name,#text}]` form) has no verdict → **per-EID severity/MITRE fallback**. Two different rules on the same event stay separate; the same rule firing repeatedly aggregates into a counted row; events are tagged **Chainsaw / EVTX** as `sources`; the artifact's own time is used. Optional `minSeverity` floor (blank keeps everything). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, detections, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import Chainsaw/EVTX** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-hayabusa` | Import a **Hayabusa** (Yamato Security) detection timeline — JSON/JSONL (`hayabusa json-timeline`) **or** CSV (`hayabusa csv-timeline`, the default): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Sister of `import-chainsaw`; persists the file as evidence then maps it **deterministically** (no AI extraction), **verdict-first** — the matched Sigma rule's **`Level` → severity**, **`RuleTitle`** leads the description, `MitreTactics`/`MitreTags` (`Txxxx`) → MITRE. IOCs/host/process-chain come from the rendered detail fields (the CSV `Details`/`ExtraFieldInfo` cells' `Key: value ¦ …` form is parsed back into fields). Both `crit`/`critical` & `med`/`medium` levels accepted; the timestamp offset is honored to UTC; events tagged **Hayabusa**; repetitive events aggregate + cap; optional `minSeverity` floor (blank keeps everything). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import Hayabusa** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-log` | Import a generic log file (firewall — Cisco ASA, pfSense, iptables, Palo Alto, Fortinet; syslog; sshd / auth.log; IIS / Apache / nginx access; Windows event-log text exports; VPN/IKE; application logs — anything line-oriented, typically `.log` or `.txt`): `{ filename, text }`. Persists the raw file as evidence, then **deduplicates** the lines into counted patterns and asks the AI to triage them, adding **only security-relevant** events to the timeline (routine noise like VPN rekeying/retransmissions is skipped). Repeated activity is **collapsed into one aggregated event** carrying an occurrence `count` and first→last time span (e.g. "20 failed logins…"). Any timestamp format is read (ISO-8601, RFC 3164 syslog, Apache, IIS, epoch…). Returns `202 { accepted, file, lines }`; progress streams over the WS. The dashboard's **Import Log** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-velociraptor` | Import **Velociraptor native JSON** — collection results / hunt exports: `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Reads a JSON array, **JSONL** (the native form), a single object, an Elastic-style wrapper, or a Velociraptor **multi-artifact map** (`{ "Artifact.Name": [rows] }`). Persists the file as evidence then maps it **deterministically** (no AI extraction): each row is **classified** — **Sigma** detections map verdict-first (rule level→severity, title→description, tags→MITRE) over the parsed event; **YARA** hits → High detections with rule + scanned file/process + hash; parsed **EVTX** rows (`System`+`EventData`, EventID number or `{Value}`) reuse the per-EID mapping; other artifacts (pslist/netstat/file listing…) auto-detect time/host/IOCs. Reads the **artifact's own time** (not the `_ts` collection time unless nothing better); IOCs pulled from every column; events tagged **Velociraptor**; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor (`low` drops the Info raw-collection rows). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, rows, detections, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import Velociraptor** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-network` | Import **Suricata `eve.json`** + **Zeek JSON** network logs (Security Onion's network side): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Reads NDJSON (native), an array, or an Elastic wrapper; routes per record (Suricata `event_type`, Zeek `_path`). Persists the file as evidence then maps it **deterministically** (no AI extraction): the **timeline is built from the detections** — Suricata **`alert`** (signature→description, `alert.severity`→severity, `alert.metadata`→MITRE, flow 5-tuple) and Zeek **`notice`** — while **telemetry** (`dns`/`http`/`tls`/`fileinfo`/`files`/`ssl`/`x509`) contributes **IOCs only** (domains, URLs, file hashes, alert/notice IPs), keeping the timeline signal-rich. The artifact's own time is used (Suricata offset ts, Zeek epoch `ts`); events tagged **Suricata**/**Zeek**; alerts aggregate + cap; optional `minSeverity` floor on alert events (telemetry IOCs kept regardless). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, alerts, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import Suricata/Zeek** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-kape` | Import a **KAPE / Eric Zimmerman Tools CSV** (host-forensics triage): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. The producing EZ tool is **auto-detected from the CSV header**, then each row maps **deterministically** (no AI extraction) to a forensic event reading the **artifact's own time** + file/hash/process IOCs. Supports **Prefetch** (PECmd), **Amcache** (AmcacheParser, incl. SHA1), **ShimCache/AppCompatCache** (AppCompatCacheParser), **LNK** (LECmd), **JumpLists** (JLECmd), **UsnJrnl $J** & **$MFT** (MFTECmd, files only), **SRUM** (SrumECmd), **Recycle Bin** (RBCmd), **Shellbags** (SBECmd). Evidence rows (Info severity); the .NET min-date sentinel is dropped; events tagged by artifact name for cross-source correlation; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor. Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, artifact, events, rows, groups, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import KAPE/EZ** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-cybertriage` | Import a **Cyber Triage** (Sleuth Kit Labs) timeline export (host triage): `{ filename, text, minSeverity?, fileTelemetry? }`. Reads the **JSONL** (richest), **JSON array**, or **CSV** timeline form. **Deterministic** (no AI extraction), **verdict-first** like Hayabusa/Velociraptor: Cyber Triage already scores items, so **scored rows** (`score` `Notable_Normal`=Bad / `LikelyNotable_Normal`=Suspicious, or the CSV `threat_level`) map to events with severity **derived from the verdict** + a keyword bump on the reason text (lsass dump/mimikatz/ransomware→Critical; RAS/AnyDesk/PsExec/YARA→High), the **`scoreDescription`** leads the description, MITRE from the reason (lsass→T1003.001, RAS→T1219, scheduled task→T1053.005, UAC-bypass→T1548.002), and the process chain / path / host / args are carried through. The export is mostly raw filesystem telemetry, so to stay signal-rich the importer **splits the feed**: unscored **Process + Scheduled-Task** rows → **Info** evidence (a bounded execution/persistence timeline); the unscored **File** MFT super-timeline is **dropped by default** (`fileTelemetry:true` opts it back in); **network** rows contribute the **remote IP as an IOC** only. Events tagged **Cyber Triage**; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor. Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, format, events, rows, notable, groups, iocs }`. (The CSV form is **lossy** — no host, no process chain; prefer the JSONL export.) The dashboard's single **Import** button auto-detects and routes here. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-m365` | Import **Microsoft 365 / Entra ID** audit data (cloud/identity IR): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Auto-detects and maps the **M365 Unified Audit Log** (`Search-UnifiedAuditLog` CSV/JSON or Management Activity API — the `AuditData` JSON blob is parsed/merged), **Entra sign-in logs**, and **Entra directory audit logs**. **Deterministic** (no AI extraction): severity is **derived from the operation** (BEC tradecraft — inbox/transport rules, mailbox delegation, OAuth/service-principal grants, role additions, password resets, failed sign-ins → High/Medium + MITRE), while **Entra `riskLevel`** (Identity Protection) drives severity directly. Source IPs (de-bracketed from `[ip]:port`) become IOCs; the UPN is surfaced for the asset graph. Events tagged **Microsoft 365**/**Entra ID**; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor. Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import M365/Entra** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-aws` | Import **AWS CloudTrail** logs (cloud IR): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Reads the `{ Records: [...] }` envelope, NDJSON (CloudTrail Lake/Athena), or an array. **Deterministic** (no AI extraction): severity is **derived from the API action** (IAM persistence/priv-esc, CloudTrail/GuardDuty/flow-log tampering, S3 exposure, AMI/snapshot sharing, secrets access → High/Medium + MITRE), with bumps for a present `errorCode` (denied probe), `userIdentity.type == Root`, and failed/root ConsoleLogin. The caller `sourceIPAddress` becomes an IOC (AWS-service callers ignored); the principal (IAM user / assumed-role issuer) is in the description. Events tagged **AWS CloudTrail**; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor (drops routine reads). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import AWS CloudTrail** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-cloud-activity` | Import **GCP Cloud Audit Logs** + **Azure Activity Log** (cloud IR): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Auto-detects per record — GCP (`protoPayload` AuditLog / `cloudaudit` logName) and Azure (`operationName` + `caller`, native camelCase **or** flat Log-Analytics PascalCase). **Deterministic** (no AI extraction): severity is **derived from the action** via per-cloud rule tables (service-account keys/IAM role grants, logging-sink/diagnostic deletion, firewall opens, storage exposure, secret/key-vault & storage-key access, snapshot/image sharing, VM run-command → High/Medium + MITRE), bumped when the call was denied (`status.code != 0` / `Failed`). The caller IP becomes an IOC; the principal email is surfaced for the asset graph. Events tagged **GCP Audit**/**Azure Activity**; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor. Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, events, records, groups, format, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import GCP/Azure** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-plaso` | Import a **Plaso / log2timeline** super-timeline (`psort` CSV): `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. Header-detects the **dynamic** (`datetime,message,…`) and legacy **l2tcsv** (`date,time,timezone,…,desc,…`) flavours. **Deterministic** (no AI extraction): each row → an **Info** evidence event at its own time (l2tcsv MM/DD/YYYY+time+tz → UTC); IOCs (hashes/URLs/IPs, octet-bounded so version strings aren't mistaken for IPs) + the source file path are scraped from the message; the l2tcsv `host` attributes the event. Tagged **Plaso**; repetitive rows aggregate + cap (*filter your psort output first*). Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, format, events, rows, groups, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import Plaso** button calls this. |
| `POST /cases/:id/import-sandbox` | Import a **malware-sandbox** detonation report — **CAPEv2** (`report.json`) or **CrowdStrike Falcon Sandbox** (Hybrid Analysis summary JSON), auto-detected: `{ filename, text, minSeverity? }`. **Deterministic** (no AI extraction): the **sample verdict** (CAPE `malscore`/family, Falcon `verdict`/`threat_score`/`vx_family`) + **each behavioural signature** become events with their own severity + MITRE (CAPE `ttp`, Falcon `mitre_attcks`/`attck_id`); dropped/extracted-file hashes and network hosts/domains/URLs are harvested as IOCs. Accepts an array of reports. Events tagged **CAPEv2**/**Falcon Sandbox**; aggregates + caps; optional `minSeverity` floor. Then synthesizes. Returns `202 { accepted, file, format, events, signatures, iocs }`. The dashboard's **Import Sandbox** button calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/state` | Current investigation state (JSON). |
| `GET /cases/:id/evidence/:file` | Serve a piece of evidence (a screenshot or an imported CSV) by filename. Sandboxed to the case's `screenshots/` and `imports/` dirs (no path separators or `..`). The dashboard links findings/events to this so a click opens the artifact. |
| `GET /cases/:id/captures/count` | Number of captures recorded for the case. |
| `GET /cases/:id/scope` | Current investigation time-window: `{ start, end }` (ISO or null). |
| `POST /cases/:id/scope` | `{ start, end }` — set the window; re-synthesizes using only in-scope events. The dashboard's scope bar calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/legitimate` | List client-confirmed legitimate findings/IOCs/events (excluded from analysis). |
| `POST /cases/:id/legitimate` | `{ kind: "finding"\|"ioc"\|"event", ref, note, label? }` — mark a finding (ref = title), IOC (ref = value), or **forensic event** (ref = event id; `label` = its description for display) legitimate; re-runs synthesis without it. The dashboard's per-item **⚑ mark legitimate** button calls this. Legit **events** are hidden from the timeline and excluded from synthesis input but the raw event is preserved in state, so un-marking restores it. |
| `POST /cases/:id/legitimate/remove` | `{ id }` — un-mark; re-runs synthesis. |
| `GET /cases/:id/ai-control` | Current AI on/off state: `{ enabled, lastAnalyzedSeq }`. |
| `POST /cases/:id/ai-control` | `{ enabled }` — turn AI analysis on/off for the case. **Defaults off** (a fresh case captures evidence without running AI). Evidence is always captured; when off, no AI runs. Turning it **on** backfills every screenshot captured while it was off. The dashboard's **AI: ON/OFF** button calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/enrich-control` | Per-source enrichment state: `{ anyConfigured, providers: [{ name, scope, enabled }] }`. `scope` is `local` (your own MISP/YETI — OPSEC-safe) or `external` (third-party SaaS). |
| `POST /cases/:id/enrich-control` | `{ providers: [names] }` (or legacy `{ enabled }`) — set which sources are enabled for the case. **Default is local-only** (OPSEC-safe). Saving enriches the current IOCs and auto-enriches IOCs added later; **enabling a source re-checks every IOC on it** (per-source cache via `enrichedBy`). The dashboard's **Enrich** picker calls this. Stored in `state/enrich-control.json`. |
| `POST /cases/:id/enrich` | Manual one-shot IOC enrichment (does not change the toggle). Looks up the case's IOCs (hashes/IPs/domains/URLs) on the configured providers — **VirusTotal** (`DFIR_VT_KEY`), **MalwareBazaar** (`DFIR_MB_KEY`), **AbuseIPDB** (`DFIR_ABUSEIPDB_KEY`), **MISP** (`DFIR_MISP_URL` + `DFIR_MISP_KEY`), **RockyRaccoon** (`DFIR_ROCKYRACCOON_KEY`, **process** names — prevalence / LOLBIN / risk / expected parent / ATT&CK), **YETI** (`DFIR_YETI_URL` + `DFIR_YETI_KEY`, your own instance) — and annotates each with a verdict/score/link. Cached on the IOC (skips already-enriched unless `{ force: true }`); throttled (`DFIR_ENRICH_DELAY_MS`) and capped (`DFIR_ENRICH_MAX`, hashes/IPs first). **Reachability-gated**: a self-hosted MISP/YETI that's down is health-probed (cached ~60s) before sending, then skipped + retried rather than blasted one request per IOC. `501` if no provider key is set. **⚠ OPSEC: sends indicators to third-party services.** |
| `GET /enrich-health` | Reachability of the configured providers (for the dashboard's ●up/down dots): `{ providers: [{ name, scope, probed, ok, detail? }] }`. Probes each self-hosted source (MISP `GET /servers/getVersion`; YETI API-token exchange), cached ~60s (`DFIR_ENRICH_HEALTH_TTL_MS`). Providers without a health endpoint (external SaaS) report `probed:false, ok:true`. A background poller (`DFIR_ENRICH_HEALTH_POLL_MS`, default 60s, `=0` off) re-probes down servers and auto-resumes enrichment for cases it had to skip. |
| `POST /cases/:id/synthesize` | Run the synthesis pass (findings / MITRE / attacker path) from the forensic timeline; pushes the update to the dashboard. The dashboard's **Synthesize** button calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/import-meta` | Last-import record for the dashboard's **📥 Last import N ago — +N new events / +N new IOCs** banners above the Forensic Timeline and IOCs: `{ lastImportedAt, lastImportKind, lastImportFile, addedCount, removedCount, lastDiff: { added, removed }, iocsAddedCount, iocsRemovedCount, iocsDiff: { added, removed } }`. Written by the unified `/import` route after each import completes (diffs the timeline before/after by normalized time+description, and the IOCs by exact value); drives the per-row `NEW` highlights. Stored in `state/import-meta.json`; pushed live over the WS (`import_meta_changed`). |
| `POST /cases/:id/ask` | `{ question }` → ask the LLM a free-form question about the case ("was data exfiltrated?", "was a USB connected?"). Single-shot, no state change; returns `{ answer, status (answered/partial/unknown), pointer (which artifact to collect/where), relatedEventIds }`. |
| `POST /cases/:id/questions` | `{ question, answer?, status?, pointer? }` → add an analyst question to the case's key questions, **pinned** (preserved across synthesis, which answers it once the evidence supports it). The dashboard's **Add to open questions** button calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/comments` · `POST` · `DELETE …/:commentId` | **Investigator comments** on any entity. POST `{ targetType, targetId, author, text }` adds one; DELETE removes by id. Stored in `state/comments.json` (never wiped by synthesis); add/remove ping dashboard clients over the WS for live collaboration. The 💬 chips on events/findings/IOCs/questions/threads call these. |
| `POST /cases/:id/report` | Write report files; returns their paths. `report.md` **and** `report.html` follow the [AnttiKurittu incident-report-template](https://github.com/AnttiKurittu/incident-report-template): technical sections auto-fill from the case, human-authored sections come from report metadata (below). |
| `GET /cases/:id/report/report.md` · `…/report.html` | Serve a generated report for export (view or download). `?download=1` forces a save dialog; on the HTML, `?print=1` injects a print trigger so the browser opens its **Save as PDF** dialog on load (the PDF export — the on-disk file is never modified); `404` until the report has been generated. The HTML export is standalone and print-friendly; raw HTML in untrusted data is escaped. |
| `GET /cases/:id/report.docx` | Download the incident report as a **Word `.docx`** — generated on demand from the current case state (same scope/legitimate filtering as the Markdown and HTML exports). Headings, GFM tables, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and inline emphasis all map across. The `.docx` is not persisted to disk; each request regenerates it. Always returns an attachment download. The dashboard's **Export** menu → **Generate report (Word .docx)** calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/incident-timeline.csv` | Export **just the incident (forensic) timeline** as CSV, generated on demand (same scope/legitimate filtering as the report) — no full report needed. The dashboard's **Export Timeline CSV** button calls this. |
| `GET /cases/:id/timeline.jsonl` | Export the incident (forensic) timeline as **Timesketch-compatible JSONL** (`message`/`datetime`/`timestamp_desc` + searchable fields, one event per line; same scope/legitimate filtering). Upload it into a Timesketch sketch manually, or use the dashboard's **Push to Timesketch** button. The **Export Timesketch JSONL** button calls this. |
| `GET /timesketch/status` · `POST /cases/:id/push/timesketch` | Whether a Timesketch target is configured, and push the case's forensic timeline into a sketch (logs in, find-or-creates the sketch by name = case id, clean-replaces the managed timeline, uploads). Enabled by `DFIR_TIMESKETCH_URL` + `_USER` + `_PASSWORD`. |
| `GET /cases/:id/asset-graph` | The **asset ↔ IoC graph**: `{ assets, iocs, edges }` — compromised assets (hosts from each event's `asset`, accounts parsed from event text) and the IoCs that touched each. Derived on demand with the report's scope/legitimate filtering. Powers the dashboard's *Compromised Assets* section and graph. |
| `GET /cases/:id/report-meta` | Human-authored report metadata (optional company name + logo branding, title page, distribution, BIA, limitations, glossary, recommendations…) for the case, or defaults. Stored in `state/report-meta.json` (the logo inline as a base64 data URI). |
| `PUT /cases/:id/report-meta` | Replace the report metadata with a normalized payload (unknown keys dropped, wrong-typed fields defaulted). The dashboard's **Case Details** panel calls this; values merge into `report.md` on generation. |
| `GET /dashboard` | Live dashboard page. |
| `WS /ws?caseId=<id>` | Live state + AI-status push for the dashboard. |

## How analysis works (two phases)

1. **Per-window extraction.** Non-duplicate captures are buffered per case and
   flushed to the AI when the window fills (default 4) or on a significant trigger
   (navigation / tab switch). Each window is merged into the persistent state by id
   (revisiting a topic updates, never duplicates). This phase is good at pulling
   **dated forensic events** out of the artifacts into the forensic timeline.
2. **Holistic synthesis.** Findings, MITRE mapping, and the attacker-path narrative
   need the *whole* timeline at once — a single window can't see it. So a synthesis
   pass reads the full forensic timeline and produces those conclusions. It runs
   automatically at the end of `reanalyze` (skip with `--no-synthesis`), and you can
   re-run it any time — including with a different model — via `npm run synthesize`.

**Investigation scope (time window).** The evidence often includes earlier, unrelated
activity. Set a **from/to** window in the dashboard's scope bar — synthesis then re-runs
using only in-scope forensic events, so findings, IOCs, attacker path, key questions, the
timeline view, and the report all reflect only that window. The raw events are preserved
(stored in `state/scope.json`), so widening or clearing the window restores them. Because
synthesis is an authoritative reassessment, it now **replaces** the analytic layer each run
rather than accumulating — so out-of-scope (or removed) conclusions drop cleanly.

**Confirmed-legitimate items (false positives).** When the client confirms an alert,
tool, IOC, or a specific forensic-timeline event was their own benign activity, click
**⚑ mark legitimate** on that finding / IOC / **event** in the dashboard (add a reason).
It's stored per case (`state/legitimate.json`), synthesis is re-run **excluding it**, and
it's listed in the "Confirmed Legitimate (excluded from analysis)" panel where you can
un-mark it. Findings/IOCs are dropped via both the prompt and a hard post-filter.
A legitimate **event** is hidden from the timeline view and excluded from the synthesis
input — but the raw event stays in state (it's evidence), so un-marking fully restores
it. Reports honor all of these exclusions too.

**Log import (firewall / syslog / VPN / access logs).** Log files are mostly
repetition, so importing one does **not** add a timeline row per line. The raw lines
are first **deduplicated deterministically** into distinct patterns (volatile tokens —
sequence numbers, IDs, ports, the trailing `_N` of identifiers — are masked; source IP
addresses are kept), each with an occurrence count and first/last time. The AI then
**triages the patterns** and adds timeline events only for the **security-relevant**
ones (auth failures / brute force, blocked traffic, scans, IDS/IPS hits, config/account
changes, beaconing/exfil, abnormal failure volume). Routine operational noise — VPN/IPsec
rekeying, IKE retransmissions, heartbeats, successful benign connections — is **skipped**,
even at high volume. Each emitted event is an **aggregate**: it carries a `count` and a
first→last span and reads like "20 failed SSH logins for root from 1.2.3.4 between …".
The dashboard shows a `×N` badge; reports include `count`/`endTimestamp` columns. A pure
operational log can legitimately yield **zero** timeline events — that's the correct,
signal-first outcome. (To re-process a log you imported before this behavior existed,
`npm run reanalyze -- <case> --reset` to clear the old per-line events, then re-upload the
log file from the dashboard.)

**High-severity rows become findings.** If an artifact row carries its own
Severity / Level / Criticality column reading **Critical**, **High**, or **Severe**
(e.g. a Microsoft Defender or EDR detection), it is treated as a finding by default —
the extraction and synthesis prompts are told a high-severity row is ~90% of the time a
finding. As a deterministic safety net, after each synthesis any in-scope, non-legitimate
**Critical/High** forensic event that synthesis left without a finding gets one
auto-created and linked (id prefix `f-auto-`, badged **AUTO** in the dashboard) so a
severe detection can never be silently missed. Refine or mark it legitimate as needed.

**Capture-only mode (the default).** AI analysis is **off by default** per case, so a
fresh app start or a new case captures screenshots as evidence without running any AI
until you opt in — the same OPSEC/cost-first stance as threat-intel enrichment. The
dashboard's **AI: ON/OFF** button (per case) turns live analysis on; when you switch it
on, the server automatically analyzes everything captured while it was off (tracked by
`lastAnalyzedSeq` in `state/ai-control.json`), then synthesizes. Explicit imports
(CSV / log / THOR / SIEM-EDR JSON) always analyze regardless of this toggle.

**Anonymization (default on).** Before any text is sent to the LLM (screenshot-window
context, CSV, log, Ask, synthesis), sensitive *victim* data is replaced with reversible
typed tokens (`ANON_HOST_1`, `ANON_USER_2`, …) and secrets are one-way-redacted to
`[REDACTED_SECRET]`. The model's response is restored to real values before it reaches
the timeline, IOCs, findings, or the dashboard — so `InvestigationState` and all exports
always contain the real data ("tokenize-in-transit").

- **Tokenized (victim / internal):** RFC 1918 / loopback / CGNAT internal IPs, known
  hostnames / FQDNs, `DOMAIN\user` / internal-UPN accounts, internal / AD domains,
  emails, and the username segment of user-profile paths (`C:\Users\<name>\…`).
- **Preserved (adversary / IOC):** public IPs, malware hashes, attacker domains — so
  threat signal and threat-intel enrichment survive with real indicators.
- **Secrets** (AWS keys, JWTs, GitHub/Slack tokens, `password=` / `Authorization: Bearer …`,
  URL credentials) are **one-way redacted** (`[REDACTED_SECRET]`), never restored.
  Hashes are deliberately NOT treated as secrets.
- **Per-case control** via the dashboard **Anon** button: enable/disable, choose which
  of the six categories to tokenize, toggle secret redaction. Persisted in
  `state/anon-control.json`. Toggling forces a re-synthesis so conclusions reflect the new
  wire policy.
- **Entity list (transparency + manual additions).** The Anon modal shows the
  *auto-derived* entities (hosts / accounts / internal domains derived from the case
  timeline — read-only, grows as the investigation does) and lets the analyst
  **add/remove custom entities** (value + category, including a free-form **"Other"**
  for codenames). Custom entities are tokenized by exact match even if that category's
  detector is off. Persisted in `state/anon-entities.json`.
- **Screenshots are best-effort.** Pixel content can't be tokenized. With an external
  vision model the screenshot images are sent as-is (the dashboard shows a warning when
  anon is on and the vision model is external). Pointing `DFIR_AI_MODEL` at a local
  Ollama vision model keeps screenshots on-box.
- `DFIR_ANONYMIZE=off` flips the default for **new** cases (existing cases keep their
  saved setting).

**Live capture and conclusions.** While you browse, the per-window extraction builds
the forensic timeline + investigation log. Screenshots are analyzed in **windows** (a
window of `--window` captures, default 4); a `timer`/`click` capture buffers until the
window fills, while a page **navigation** or **tab switch** flushes the buffer early. So
the AI doesn't always wait for four — a navigation flushes a lone screenshot immediately — but a
single hotkey snap (trigger `timer`) followed by idle would otherwise sit unanalyzed. A
**safety-net sweep** (`DFIR_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`, default 5 min; `0` disables) drains any
leftover buffer on its interval so even one screenshot is eventually analyzed. Findings,
MITRE and the attacker path come from the synthesis pass, which by default now runs
**automatically and debounced** during live capture (`DFIR_AI_AUTO_SYNTHESIZE=on`, ~8 s
after the last screenshot in a burst) and pushes updates to the dashboard. You can also trigger it manually with the
dashboard **Synthesize** button, `POST /cases/:id/synthesize`, or `npm run synthesize`.
Set `DFIR_AI_AUTO_SYNTHESIZE=off` (or raise `DFIR_AI_AUTO_SYNTHESIZE_MS`) to reduce
cost. After changing server code, **restart `npm run dev`** so the live pipeline picks
up the new prompts.

**Two-tier model strategy (cost-effective).** Per-screenshot extraction is the
high-volume part (one AI call per few screenshots) — use a cheap vision model there.
Synthesis is a single text-only call over the whole timeline — point a stronger model
at just that. Configure it once in `.env`:

    DFIR_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini          # extraction (cheap, reads every screenshot)
    DFIR_AI_SYNTH_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-pro # synthesis (strong, one text-only call)

…then just `npm run reanalyze -- <caseId> --reset`. Or set it ad-hoc on the CLI
(overrides `.env`):

    npm run reanalyze -- <caseId> --reset --model openai/gpt-4o-mini --synth-model google/gemini-2.5-pro

Duplicates (by perceptual hash) are still stored as evidence but skipped by the AI —
use `reanalyze --all` to force them in.

The **forensic timeline** holds real incident events (host/attacker activity recorded
in the artifacts: executions, logons, file/registry/network changes) with their true
event timestamps. It is NOT the analyst's work log — the act of operating Velociraptor
(creating hunts, opening notebooks, running searches, "Response and Monitoring
accessed") belongs in the Investigation Log, not here. The prompts exclude tool-usage
events; for timelines built before that fix, `npm run clean-timeline` strips them.

### Text readability / OCR accuracy

Screenshots are captured **lossless** (PNG) at the browser's full viewport resolution
(typically ~2550px wide) — capture quality is not the bottleneck. Misread usernames,
hostnames and domains usually come from (1) the vision model downscaling large images,
and (2) model OCR strength. Mitigations:

- `DFIR_AI_IMAGE_DETAIL=high` (default) tiles images at full resolution for OpenAI/
  OpenRouter models instead of downscaling — the biggest single accuracy win.
- Use a stronger vision model for text-heavy forensic screenshots, e.g.
  `openai/gpt-4o` or `google/gemini-2.5-pro` rather than a fast/cheap flash model.
  Compare cheaply on the existing timeline without re-capturing:
  `npm run synthesize -- <caseId> --model openai/gpt-4o`
- Zoom the page in the browser (Ctrl +) before/while capturing so source text is larger.

Recommended recovery flow for a case that has screenshots but weak/empty analysis:

    npm run reanalyze -- <caseId> --reset      # rebuild timeline + synthesize conclusions
    # or, if the forensic timeline already looks good and you only want conclusions:
    npm run synthesize -- <caseId>             # one cheap call; try --model to compare
